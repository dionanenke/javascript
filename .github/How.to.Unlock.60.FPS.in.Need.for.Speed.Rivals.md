2. Create a shortcut of the executable file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Create shortcut". You can place the shortcut anywhere you want, such as your desktop.
3. Right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties". In the "Target" field, you will see the path to the executable file. Add a space after it and then type the following command line parameter: -GameTime.MaxSimFps 60 -GameTime.ForceSimRate 60+
4. Click "OK" to save the changes. Your shortcut should look something like this: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Need for Speed(TM) Rivals\NFS14.exe" -GameTime.MaxSimFps 60 -GameTime.ForceSimRate 60+

## Possible Issues with Unlocking 60 FPS in Need for Speed: Rivals
 
While unlocking 60 FPS in Need for Speed: Rivals can improve your gaming experience, it can also cause some problems with the game's performance and stability. Here are some of the possible issues you may encounter:

- The game may crash or freeze randomly.

- The game's audio may be out of sync or distorted.
