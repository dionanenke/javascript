The album was produced by Neil Kernon, who also worked with Nevermore on several albums, and features guest appearances by guitarists Ron Jarzombek (Watchtower, Spastic Ink), Pat O'Brien (Cannibal Corpse, ex-Nevermore) and jazz bassist Michael Manring. Loomis plays guitar, bass and keyboards on the album, while ex-Nevermore drummer Mark Arrington handles the drums.
 
The album showcases Loomis' versatility and virtuosity as a guitarist, as he delivers fast and furious riffs, melodic and catchy hooks, complex and intricate solos and atmospheric and ambient textures. The songs are diverse and dynamic, ranging from the heavy and aggressive opener "Shouting Fire at a Funeral" to the mellow and soothing closer "Miles of Machines". Some of the highlights include "Jato Unit", which features a mind-blowing trade-off between Loomis and Jarzombek, "Cashmere Shiv", which features a fretless guitar solo by Kernon and a bass solo by Manring, and "Sacristy", which features a haunting acoustic intro and a powerful electric climax.
 
**Zero Order Phase** is a must-have for any fan of instrumental metal or guitar music in general. It is a testament to Loomis' talent and vision as a musician and composer. It is also a rare example of an instrumental album that is not only technically impressive but also emotionally engaging and enjoyable.
